# TATA

### Brief - The app should "address" healthy eating.

## Ideas
- Recipe finder
- Calorie counter
- Barcode scanner

## Maybe useful APIs:
- https://developer.edamam.com/ For providing recipes.
- https://www.barcodelookup.com/api For turning barcodes into product names.


## Questions
- PWA, native, flutter, react? - I would rule out native because it splits code between ios and android.  PWA would allow app to be accessed through the browser. Flutter is weird but interesting. I don't know anything about react but it sounds good.
- Back end - python? php?
- Do we provide a login mechanism and therefore what database do we use to store passwords?
